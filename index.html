					<p> The largest lake in Brooklyn becomes a deadly hazard in the winter as temperatures dip and the water freezes over. The parks department aims to keep cold weather park goers safe by deploying red 10-foot ladders throughout park’s waterways.  </p>

					<p>The map to the left displays locations and images for all 44 ice ladders in Prospect Park. The ladders surround the entirety of Prospect Park Lake, most of them existing toward the southern part of the park, where the lake is largest. There are five ladders in the north section of the lake by the popular Dog Beach where New Yorkers actually have access to the water. </p>

					<p>The ladders are taken care of by the parks department and are technically only to be used by parks staff. Posted with each ladder is a sign displaying the ladder number and what to do in an ice emergency. There is also a reminder to report ladder issues to the city by calling 311. </p>

					<p>The Park’s Department says need to be careful how they handle and ice emergency, </p>

					<p>“If you witness someone falling through ice, never attempt to make a rescue by yourself: call 911 and notify the proper authorities. Be sure to give the exact location and an account of the incident,” they said in a statement. </p>

					<p>The ladders also display information on their location and closest cross streets within the park.</p>

					<p>All the ladders are where they’re supposed to be. Only ladder 43, north of the boathouse, was not properly racked, instead lying in the dirt next to its respective sign. The position labeled 23, north of the peninsula, actually supplied two ladders. Data from the city show only one ladder per position. </p>
